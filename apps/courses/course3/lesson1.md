# Lesson 1: Introduction

## What is considered an attack in cybersecurity?

When people think of an **attack in cyberspace**, what usually comes to mind is a hacker in a dark room hidden behind a mask and their computer screen. However, attacks come in a **multitude of forms** that range from hacking computer systems to mundane social interactions.

A **cyberattack** is an attempt to **damage or gain access** to a computer system or network, often with **malicious intent**. Cyberattacks **threaten** the safety of digital assets and **information** which can lead to financial or reputational **damage** for individuals and companies.

An intrusion into a computer does not have to be successful for it to be considered an attack. Even a **failed attempt** at hacking is enough for companies to begin troubleshooting system vulnerabilities that attackers find. An attack does not necessarily have to be **directly hacking** into a system either. Attackers sometimes uncover valuable information through everyday conversations with people or through prior research of their target.

This course covers the **basic types of attacks** and **attackers**, as well as their **motives**. Let's get into it!
