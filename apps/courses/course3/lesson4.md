# Lesson 4: Phishing Attacks

## What is a Phishing Attack?

A **phishing attack** is a **social engineering attack** in which the attacker deceives the victim into revealing personal information. **Phishing** usually involves some form of impersonation, increasing the chances that a victim will fall for the attack.

## Types of Phishing Attacks:

- **Traditional:** The most common phishing, sent through email
- **Vishing:** Voice phishing, phishing over a phone call
- **SMishing:** SMS phishing, phishing through text conversations

There are also **different types of phishing** depending on the target. For example, **Spear Phishing** is used when targeting an individual. Another example is **Whaling**, where a high-profile person, such as a CEO, is targeted.

## Characteristics of Phishing:

- **Grammar/Spelling mistakes:** senders from a legit company are unlikely to make these mistakes to maintain professionalism
- **Unknown sender:** this includes people who you have never contacted before or company names that are unfamiliar
- **Suspicious links:** the domain or name of the website looks unfamiliar or not legit, never click on these types of links!
- **Suspicious attachments:** same deal as the suspicious links. If you are unsure that it is safe, do not click it!
- **Unrealistically good offers:** if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Check for other signs of phishing and refrain from clicking anything phishy.
- **Asking for personal information:** unless you know the company or person you are sending it to, never send out your personal information
- **Urgent or threatening tone:** this goes back to the principles of social engineering. Urgency and intimidation are used by attackers to get people to do what they want, beware of this!

In this next **activity**, we are going to use these **characteristics** of **phishing** to see if you can identify **phishing attacks**.
