# Lesson 3: Social Engineering

## Social Engineering:

A vital topic in cybersecurity is the concept of **social engineering**. Social engineering is the exploitation of human error in order to manipulate people into compromising security. This is relevant in **cybersecurity** because social engineering can be used to trick people into revealing information that can be used to **compromise** computer systems. Social engineers use the principles of social engineering to be successful in exploiting their targets:

## Principles of Social Engineering:

The Principles of Social Engineering are the specific methods in which **social engineers and cyber attackers** use to get information out of people. They are:

- **Authority**: impersonating a figure of authority
- **Intimidation**: intimidating, or threatening victims
- **Persuading**: victims that other people are doing something, so they should too
- **Scarcity**: asserting that there is a limited amount of something
- **Urgency**: asserting that there is limited time to do something
- **Familiarity/Liking**: gaining the favor of victims to build trust
- **Trust**: exploiting victims' trust

These principles aim to exploit certain **human traits and emotions**. For example, **authority and intimidation** cause people to make decisions out of fear. Others, such as **familiarity/liking**, cause people to willingly give up information without thinking twice.
