# Lesson 2: Threat Actors

So far in this course (and later on) the word **"attacker"** has been used to talk about people who attempt to **compromise or gain access** to a system. A more formal and **cybersecurity-specific** term for this is a **"threat actor."** A threat actor is an individual or group who carries out cyberattacks. Cybersecurity professionals must be familiar with the **motives** and **level of risk** that different threat actors possess in order to know how to deal with them.

## Types of Threat Actors:

## Script Kiddies:

Script Kiddies are **inexperienced hackers**. Sometimes, they are inexperienced to the point where they are not really sure what they are doing. However, they could still cause more **accidental damage** to a system than an experienced hacker would intentionally inflict. Without control over what they are doing, they can have devastating impacts. If they manage to be a little less destructive, script kiddies are just **nuisances to businesses** and individuals.

## Insider Threats:

An insider threat is a **threat from someone who has already had access to a system**. An example of this could be a **company employee** attempting to share confidential information to competitors. Since insiders know the **information, structure, or credentials** to a system, they could share them at any moment to anyone, making them a cybersecurity risk. Insiders don't even have to be technology professionals, they just need to reveal enough to other threat actors who will take advantage of their information.

## Criminals/Crime Groups:

Cybercriminals primarily seek **financial gain**, either through **hacking** to steal or **ransom**. Within the category of cybercriminals, organized crime groups are **more sophisticated** in their techniques and are **more dangerous** than ordinary cybercriminals.

## State-Sponsored:

State-sponsored threat actors **work for governments**. States hire **incredibly experienced and sophisticated** hackers and security professionals. This makes a government's cybersecurity **offense and defense very strong**. In regards to attacking, state-sponsored hackers are the most dangerous due to their skills and tools at their disposal.
