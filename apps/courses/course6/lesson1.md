# Lesson 1: Introduction

## What is Linux?

**Linux** is an **open-source operating system**. Like other operating systems, it connects applications to hardware. However, **Linux** runs on top of another OS, using an allotted amount of resources from the computer's total resources to support itself. Many distributions, or distros, of **Linux** are derived from other major Linux distributions such as **RedHat, Debian, and Ubuntu,** so functionality can vary between different distros. The majority of **Linux** distros also use a command-line interface. This means that the user gives the OS instructions by typing commands in rather than relying on graphics.

## Why Use Linux?

**Linux** is the go-to OS for **cybersecurity**. Even though it is less straightforward than **graphic-based OSes**, it is optimized for security. It gives users control over entire systems with options that they can **micro-manage**, such as users and groups, file permissions, etc. **Linux** is also used for **offensive security**. **Linux** can be used to exploit systems and devices and establish secure connections.

In this course, you will learn the very basics of how to use **Linux** and why these actions are important. **Let's begin!**
