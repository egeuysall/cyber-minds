# Lesson 2: Setting Up Linux

## 1. Install VirtualBox [here](https://www.virtualbox.org)

VirtualBox is a **virtual machine** application which will allow Linux distros to run on it, separating what we do on Linux from what we do outside of it.

## 2. Download a Linux distro.

We highly recommend **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS**. They are very similar because they are both derivatives of **Debian**. Both are also commonly used and beginner-friendly.

Download **Kali Linux** [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-platforms). Click on **"Installer Images"** and download the first result.

Download **Parrot OS** [here](https://www.parrotsec.org/download/). For our activities, the home version is enough, but it is okay to choose another version.

## 3. On Virtual Box, click on "New".

You can put anything for the title. Select your downloaded Linux distro under **ISO image** (should have a .iso extension). VirtualBox will prompt you to select how much of your current resources you want to allocate to Linux. You can click **next** with all the default settings they give you.

## 4. Once you have set up your Linux distro on VirtualBox, we need to install the distro itself.

For **Parrot** and **Kali**, you can follow these resources:

Congrats! You have successfully set up Linux.
