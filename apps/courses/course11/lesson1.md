# Lesson 1: Introduction

Cloud computing allows organizations to host applications, store data, and run services without maintaining physical hardware. This flexibility comes with new security challenges because cloud resources are reachable from the internet and can be created or changed very quickly.

Attackers often target cloud systems because a single weak setting or exposed credential can compromise an entire environment.

**Cybersecurity in the cloud** requires understanding how cloud providers operate and how responsibilities are shared. It also requires strong identity controls, careful configuration management, and continuous monitoring. When these elements work together, organizations can run secure and resilient cloud systems.
