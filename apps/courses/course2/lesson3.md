# Lesson 3: Cybersecurity for Companies

## The Importance of Cybersecurity for Companies

While companies have more robust **security** systems, they can still be attacked. Companies can be targeted by competitors looking to gain an advantage or by **cybercriminals** seeking the company's money. It is vital that companies protect themselves from cyberthreats because attacks against them can affect the people they serve. Without **proper** security, people will not trust companies to handle their data. Both parties can suffer a financial loss or theft of personal data with companies being especially vulnerable to **reputational damage**.

## Actions that Companies Take:

You will learn about more defensive measures in course 4, but here are some topics to get you started:

- **Training/Awareness:** training that companies provide their employees or even their clients on security prevents people from making blunders that can risk the companies welfare.
- **Intrusion Detection Tools:** Companies use tools to warn them of intrusions or suspicious activity on their systems
- **Policies:** Both company policies and mandatory policies levied by the government improve the security of company systems

## Frameworks:

A framework in cybersecurity is a model that dictates how companies should respond to security incidents. There are a variety of frameworks that companies can choose to use, some of them being a company's own framework. In the following example, we will look at the **NIST CSF.**

**NIST** is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and they created the **NIST CSF** or the **NIST** Cybersecurity Framework. This is one of the most popular frameworks used by organizations. This is the NIST CSF:

## Stages of the NIST CSF

1. **Identify:** Identifying assets and areas in a system where attacks can occur.
2. **Protect:** Taking necessary measures to protect assets and seal attack vectors in preparation for possible attacks.
3. **Detect:** Once an attack occurs, the source of the attack and areas of the system that were affected must be detected.
4. **Respond:** Containing the attack and its effects to a certain area and eliminating the attack.
5. **Recover:** Restoring the system back to its original state, fixing vulnerabilities that led to the attack, and reflecting on what could have been done better.
