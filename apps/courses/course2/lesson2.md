# Lesson 2: Cybersecurity for Individuals

## Cyber-Threats to Individuals:

Individuals are most likely to be targeted by cybercriminals in search of money. This is especially true for the **elderly population**, who are not as familiar with technology as **younger people**. Unlike companies, there are not many security policies that individuals have to adhere to. Obviously, there are **laws** prohibiting unauthorized hacking and offensive actions. However, when it comes to policies for ordinary internet users to keep themselves **safe**, it is really a matter of preference as to how they want to do it.

Without taking any security measures, individuals make themselves **vulnerable** to revealing their data which can lead to financial loss or hindrances in **daily life.**

## Actions Individuals Should Take...

Regardless of your **role** on the internet, there are some security recommendations that everyone should try to follow! From basic to more advanced, here are some things that you can implement to protect yourself from **cyberattacks.**

## General Recomendations (Applicable to Everyone):

## Passwords:

It is vital that you use **strong password**. Here are the qualities of a **strong password:**

- **No** full **words** or phrases
- **No** relation **to** you
- **Include** a variety of different **characters** (uppercase, lowercase, special, numbers)
- **At** least **8 characters** in length

**Websites** and **Applications** usually force users to adhere to these password guidelines for the purpose of **security.** However, when these guidelines are not **enforced**, it is the user's responsibility to set a password that is **secure.** Here are some examples of passwords:

## Good Passwords:

- X9Gj\*j3^8
- @kl9$lKd3#

## Bad Passwords:

- iLoveCats123
- 12345678
- Password
- tHeGu1tar

Lastly, you should not write down your passwords on paper or digitally. You should always use a password manager because they are optimized for security.

## Other General Recomendations:

- **Use a VPN:** a Virtual Private Network will establish secure connections between devices and encrypt data in transit to prevent someone from intercepting your communications
- **Avoid Unsecure Websites:** generally avoid HTTP sites, they are not as secure as HTTPS
- **Don't** click on suspicious links or files
- **Don't** reveal personal information to untrusted people
