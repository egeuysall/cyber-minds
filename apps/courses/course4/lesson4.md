# Lesson 4: Automation Tools

## SIEM and SOAR:

**SIEM** stands for Security Information and Event Management, while **SOAR** stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. **SIEM** tools help filter system interactions while alerting security professionals about suspicious activity. **SIEM** tools have a dashboard with a variety of graphs and logs that aid cybersecurity professionals. **SOAR** is the concept of using many methods and software to automate responses to security threats, **SIEM** is used for this.

## SIEM Tool Examples:

- **Splunk**
- **LogRhythm SIEM**

## IDS and IPS:

**IDS** stands for Intrusion Detection System, while **IPS** stands for Intrusion Prevention System. An IDS is software that detects system intrusions (or potential intrusions) and alerts the monitoring person. An IPS takes this one step further. An IPS is an IDS with the added functionality of taking measures to prevent intrusions.

## Programming:

People have the ability to code automation into security. For instance, they could write a script that sorts recent threats into different categories so they can analyze trends. Programming for security is often done with the **Python** programming language. But there are others as well. **Bash** scripting and Crontabs in Linux can be used to automate processes and commands.
