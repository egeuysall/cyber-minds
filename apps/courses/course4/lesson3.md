# Lesson 3: Authentication & Authorization

## What is the difference?

Understanding the key difference between authentication and authorization is critical in cybersecurity...

- **Authentication** confirms that users are who they say they are.
- **Authorization** gives those users permission to access a resource.

## Factors of Authentication:

- Something the user **knows:** credentials, security question, pin
- Something the user **has:** Card, Phone, Google Authenticator
- Something the user **is:** Biometrics (Fingerprint, Retina, Voice), Signature

## Takeaway:

Authentication is **"Who are you?"**
Authorization is **"What are you allowed to do?"**

## Why Does it Matter?

Establishing strong authentication and authorization systems creates a strong base for controlling access to sensitive **data** and **information.** Think of it as a double-layered defense system. Through authentication, we can verify the legitimacy of users, and if they aren't who they claim to be... we can close their access. Once authenticated, **authorization** allows defining what each user **CAN** and **CANNOT** access. This duo supports the very foundation of cybersecurity, allowing the right people to get the **needed** access. So...in simple terms, the collaborative effort of authentication and authorization acts as a shield to those that are malicious.
