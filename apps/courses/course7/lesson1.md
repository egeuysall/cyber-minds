# Lesson 1: Introduction

## More Attacks...

In course 3, we gave an introduction to **cyberattacks** and **threat actors**. If you have not already looked at the content in course 3 it is highly recommended since it establishes a good foundation of what an attack is. In that course, we talked about attacks quite broadly, without too many specifics of how exactly they work.

In course 7, we will introduce you to **other categories of attacks**, but this time, with more detail. More technical terminology will be used, especially network-related terms. It is also recommended that you read some of **course 10** before taking on this course, but it is not required There are still so many topics within cyberattacks for us to discuss, so let's not hesitate!
